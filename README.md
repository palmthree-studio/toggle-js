It stands out for its customization options and dynamic user interaction events, requiring no external dependencies.

## Features

- **User Interaction Events**: Supports custom callback functions for interactive user engagements.
- **Dependency-Free**: Built with pure JavaScript, eliminating the need for any additional libraries.

## Installation

To incorporate ToggleJS into your project, simply copy the `ToggleJS` class code into a JavaScript file, for instance, `togglejs.js`.

## How to Use

Incorporating `ToggleJS` into your project is easy. Follow these steps for a quick setup:

### 1. Add the HTML Element

Place a `toggle-js` element in your HTML file where you want the toggle to appear.

```html
<toggle-js id="myToggle"></toggle-js>
```
### 2\. Initialize ToggleJS

Include the `togglejs.js` file in your project and initialize `ToggleJS` by passing the element selector and an options object.

```html

<script src="path/to/togglejs.js"></script>
<script> // Function to call when the toggle state changes
  function myPersonalMethod(checked) {
    console.log('Toggle is now:', checked ? 'ON' : 'OFF');
  }

  // Initialize ToggleJS
  new ToggleJS('#myToggle', {
    color: '#F00000', // Custom toggle color
    onclick: myPersonalMethod // Callback to handle state changes
  }); </script>
```

### Options

When initializing `ToggleJS`, you can pass an options object to customize the toggle's behavior:

-   color: Sets the toggle's color. Default is `#ccc`.
-   onclick: A callback function that gets called whenever the toggle's state changes. The function receives a `checked` argument, which is `true` if the toggle is on, and `false` otherwise.

### Events

`ToggleJS` triggers a custom `toggleChange` event every time the toggle's state changes. You can listen to this event on the `toggle-js` element to execute custom logic:

```javascript

document.querySelector('#myToggle').addEventListener('toggleChange', function(e) {
  console.log('Toggle changed:', e.detail.checked ? 'ON' : 'OFF');
});
```
